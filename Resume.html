      <h4 class="about">Resume</h4>
      <p class="project-description">I am pursuing a Graduate Certificate in publishing from West Chester University, and I hold a BA in Philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh. I possess strong English skills for both writing and editing projects, and through my internship I have gained experience with a number of publishing and analytics programs. My experience includes proofreading, copyediting, developmental editing, content writing, and book indexing, and I have worked on projects for presses such as Routledge and McFarland. I am proficient with all major style guides—AMA, AP, APA, CMS, MLA, WIT—and I have worked  with house style guides as well. I am also proficient with Microsoft Office, Adobe, HTML, and CSS. When I'm not writing or editing, I enjoy studying philosophy. I am particularly interested in ethics, literary theory, and the analytic-continental split. </p>
